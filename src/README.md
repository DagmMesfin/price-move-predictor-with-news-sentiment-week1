This project is a modular Python-based data processing and analysis pipeline.

## Best Practices

- Keep modules focused on specific tasks.
- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names.
- Document your code with docstrings.
- Avoid global variables; use function arguments and returns instead.
- Handle exceptions gracefully.
- Write unit tests for your functions.
